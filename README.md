![samp.js - JavaScript for SA-MP](http://spiderc.net/samp.js/samp.js-new.png?t=5)

samp.js is a plugin which allows you to write scripts and gamemodes for [San Andreas Multiplayer](http://sa-mp.com/) in JavaScript.

samp.js is using version 4.3.61.23 of the V8 engine ( found in Chromium/Chrome ) and is very fast.

[Documentation](http://damospiderman.github.io/samp.js/)

##### Server Setup

Add samp.js.(dll/so) to your plugins folder. Add samp.js.(dll/so) to the plugins line in your server.cfg.

Create a new line in server.cfg and add jsfiles yourscript.js

Each script on the jsfiles line will be loaded by samp.js and be each given their own context, scripts in different contexts cannot access each others variables.

##### Native Functions

All of SAMPs native functions have been converted to JavaScript. To use these functions you will need to include the appropriate "a_{name}.inc.js" file, as you would in pawn.

Any object with pass by references now return that value or an object with multiple values. For instance GetPlayerPos:

```
var pos = GetPlayerPos(playerid);
// pos is now an object with the attributes x,y,z
```

##### Events

samp.js registers all SAMPs' events. For example OnGameModeInit. However samp.js uses it's own event system.

Use the following code to register an event in your JavaScript.

```
/***
 *	$events is samp.js native event object. 
 *	All SAMP events have On removed from them
 *	function(){} is a callback which carries the same arguments as normal SAMP callbacks with the exception of playerid
***/
$server.on("GameModeInit",function(){

});

$server.on("PlayerConnect", function(player/playerid){
	
});
```

You can register as many of these events as many times as you want in any script.

Returning 0 will stop event propagation for that event ( except for in the case of OnPlayerCommandText and OnRconCommand ).

Note: For the RconCommand to work (include loadjs,unloadjs,reloadjs) you need to have at least 1 filterscript loaded with the OnRconCommand callback ( this is a sa-mp limitation ).


##### The Player Object

Any event which would normally pass a playerid now passes in a player object instead. This player object can either be used as an object or can be used in the old playerid fashion.

The player object has a bunch of handy attributes and functions which makes it easy to do lots of things.

For instance instead of the old SetPlayerName(playerid, "newname"); and GetPlayerName(playerid) you can now do player.name = "newname"; and print(player.name);

Documentation for all the available functions can be found in the docs page.
